		<h1>I (Muksitur Rahman) am the author of this web application</h1>
		<p>
			I am a well versed fullstack (NodeJS, ExpressJS, VueJS) developer. I am
			experienced in working in agile scrum based sprint (planning, refining,
			reviewing, retro). Here are a few highlights about me.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>I can turn ideas into code.</li>
			<li>
				I write complex and structured code, that can be easily maintained and
				scaled up.
			</li>
			<li>
				As senior developer, I can create proof of concept for other developers
				to follow.
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			If you want to move forward with me, I believe I will be equally up for
			the opportunity. As I would always say, I live through code and I code
			through living.
